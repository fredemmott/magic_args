# v0.4

This page summarizes the most visible changes since v0.2

## Breaking changes

- GCC 13 is no longer supported due to missing C++23 features
  - If you are using Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, `g++-14` is also available: `apt install -y g++-14`, then use `CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++-14`
- `magic_args::incomplete_parse_reason_t` is now a variant, not an enum; the specific parse reasons are now structs that contain additional information, e.g. which argument is responsible
  - To handle all possibilities with completeness checks, use `std::visit()` with the overload pattern
- Text for various end-user messages (e.g. `--help`) has been added, extended, or clarified
- If you are specifying traits (e.g. `verbatim_names<>` or `powershell_style_parsing_traits`), these must now be the *first* template instead of the second
  - For example, replace `magic_args::parse<MyArgsType, powershell_style_parsing_traits>` with `magic_args::parse<powershell_style_parsing_traits, MyArgsType>`
  - This is for consistency with new variadic functionality, like `parse_subcommands()`; C++23 limitations make following the existing convention impractical
- Custom types: `from_string_argument()` must now return an `std::expected<void, invalid_argument_value>` instead of just `void`
- Win32 helpers: the `MAGIC_ARGS_ENABLE_WINDOWS_EXTENSIONS` macro now only affects the single-header version of `magic_args`; include `<magic_args/windows.hpp>` instead. If you need to support both, use `__has_include()`, or check for `MAGIC_ARGS_HAVE_WINDOWS_EXTENSIONS` after including `<magic_args/magic_args.hpp>`
- Win32 helpers: `magic_args::attach_to_parent_terminal()` has been moved to a `win32` sub-namespace; e.g. it can be called as `magic_args::win32::attach_to_parent_terminal()`
- Win32 helpers: overloads for `magic_args::parse()` are no longer provided; use the new `magic_args::win32::make_argv()`. This is because v0.4 contains significantly expanded functionality, and the number of required overloads would have expanded significantly. This change also allows clearer identification and handling of encoding errors

## New features

- added support for subcommands, including multicall (busybox-style) subcommands
- added `magic_args::parse_silent()`, which does not write to `stdout` or `stderr`
- added `magic_errors::is_error(...)` to concisely identify if an unexpected result is an error (e.g. `invalid_argument_value_t`) or a non-error (e.g. `help_requested_t`)
- when using GNU-style parsing (default), multiple single-argument flags can be combined, e.g. `-abc` is equivalent to `-a -b -c`
- added 'counted flags' with optional values, e.g, with `magic_args::counted_flag verbose { .mShortName = "v" };`:
  - `--verbose` or `-v` set the value to 1
  - `--verbose=3` or `-vvv` set the value to 3
  - `--verbose=3 -vv` sets the value to 5
- added support for enums, if [`<magic_enum/magic_enum.hpp>`](https://github.com/Neargye/magic_enum) is available
- `--help` now shows the default values unless default-initialized, or the empty string. Default values are always shown for enums, even if default-initialized
  - to support this for custom types, implement `formattable_argument_value(const MyCustomType& value)` in the same namespace as your custom type. It must return an `std::formattable<>`

## Other improvements

- argv parameters can now be passed as any random-access-range containing elements that are convertible to `std::string_view`
- more consistent output handling: the 'loud' functions (e.g. `parse()`) now wrap the 'silent' functions (e.g. `parse_silent()`), and produce user-visible output as needed based on the returned value
- the single-header version of *magic_args* can now be included multiple times, with additional `MAGIC_ARGS_ENABLE...` macros defined
